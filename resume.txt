   complex relationships for users, form data, teams, matches, and registration tracking with 
   data integrity and cascade deletes.

   and BGMI game IDs.

   and match operations. Implemented comprehensive error handling, validation, and response 
   standardization with appropriate HTTP status codes.

   (using Sonner library), smooth animations, and skeleton loading states. Used SWR for efficient 
   data fetching and caching.
