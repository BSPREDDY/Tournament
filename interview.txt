TOURNAMENT REGISTRATION SYSTEM - 2-MINUTE INTERVIEW EXPLANATION
================================================================================

[OPENING - 20 SECONDS]
"I built a complete tournament registration and management system for BGMI esports 
tournaments. It's a full-stack application built with Next.js and React, designed to 
handle team registrations, match management, and provide both user and admin interfaces."

[PROJECT SCOPE - 30 SECONDS]
"The system has two main user types: Regular users can register their gaming teams with 
4 players each, fill their team details and game IDs, and track their registration status. 
Admins have a comprehensive dashboard to manage users, control registration deadlines, 
configure dynamic forms, schedule matches, create tournament rooms with passwords, and 
export data."

[TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION - 40 SECONDS]
"For the backend, I used PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM to manage 12+ interconnected tables 
storing users, forms, matches, and registrations. Authentication is secure with bcrypt 
password hashing and JWT tokens in HTTP-only cookies. I created 30+ API endpoints 
handling registration, team management, and admin operations with proper error handling 
and validation."

[FRONTEND & UX - 20 SECONDS]
"The frontend uses React 19 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. I optimized performance 
with React memoization and SWR for data fetching. Users see single toast notifications, 
smooth animations, and responsive design working on all devices. The UI has a modern 
gradient design with dark mode support."

[CLOSING - 10 SECONDS]
"The application is production-ready with proper security, error handling, and performance 
optimization. It successfully manages the complete tournament workflow from registration 
through match allocation."
